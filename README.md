# QR codes everywhere!
This is a simple, easy to use, server side and light weight mod for generating QR codes in minecraft.

**Warning**: This mod creates AND PLACES the QR code at the specified location, meaning it will remove any blocks in the way!

## How does it work?
Its simple! Stand where you want the origin (bottom right corner of the code) to be, and type in `/qr <link>`. 

It works for all players, not requiring OP. For extra help type `/qr help`. The QR code always generates in front of, and to the left of the player

**NOTE**: The QR code automatically determines the size, meaning you can't set the size yourself!
